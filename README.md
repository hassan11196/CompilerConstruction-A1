# Code Generator for C Functions:

## What's code generation?

In computing, code generation is the process by which a compiler's code generator converts some intermediate representation of source code into a form that can be readily executed by a machine. Sophisticated compilers typically perform multiple passes over various intermediate forms.

## About the project

In this project, tail end recursive program is generated in C from a JSON object.

Input Directory for JSON: `input_function/`

Output Directory for C code: `output_code/`

`Build and Run Class CodeGeneratorDriver.`
